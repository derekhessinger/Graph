# Graph

This project implements different graph algorithms such as Hamiltonian cycles and Prim's Algorithm to approximate a solution to the Travelling Salesperson problem.

To run, compile GraphAlgorithms.java and run the main function to see an approximate solution with the time elapsed to visit each major U.S. city.
